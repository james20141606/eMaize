## Introduction
Heterosis is the improved or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid oﬀspring. We have studied yet the largest maize SNP dataset for traits prediction. We develop linear and non-linear models which consider relationships between diﬀerent hybrids as well as other eﬀect. Specially designed model proved to be eﬃcient and robust in prediction maize’s traits.

## Methods
We have tried many machine learning models which have many problems. Then we use two new models Mixed-Ridge and Metric-Regressor to try to solve the problem. We also try some more to try to solve the problem.
