## Introduction
Heterosis is the improved or increased function of
any biological quality in a hybrid ospring. We have
studied yet the largest maize SNP dataset for traits prediction.
We develop linear and non-linear models which
consider relationships between dierent hybrids as well
as other eect. Specially designed model proved to be
ecient and robust in prediction maizeâ€™s traits.

## Methods
We have tried many machine learning models which have many problems. Then we use two new models Mixed-Ridge and Metric-Regressor to try to solve the problem. We also try some more to try to solve the problem.
